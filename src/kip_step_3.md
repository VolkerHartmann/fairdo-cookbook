## 3. Register new KIP in Data Type Registry

After collecting all properties and their Data Types in our checklist, the next step is to create a Kernel Information Profile in the Data Type Registry. After logging in, you are able to create a new Data Type using the `Create` Dropdown Button next to the search field. Here you should select `KernelInformationProfile`.

You may now add a name for the profile as well as constributor information as shown in the screenshot above. Afterwards, you have to transfer all properties in your checklist to properties of your Kernel Information Profile entry in the Data Type Registry. For more details, please check the recipe on [Create a Data Type](./datatype_intro.md).
