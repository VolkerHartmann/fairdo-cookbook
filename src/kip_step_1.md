## 1. Search data type registry for suitable data type

This first step assumes, that you have (read) access to a Data Type Registry, e.g., [http://dtr-test.pidconsortium.eu/](http://dtr-test.pidconsortium.eu/). Open the link to the DTR in your Web Browser and query for an existing Kernel Information Profile, which might fit to your use case. The key question should be, which machine actionable decisions must be possible based on the KIP contents. There are probably a couple of basic and generic profiles available which can be reused or at least taken as an example. You may use the following decision graph showing what will be the next step depending on what you found.

In the course of this recipe we assume, that we have to create a new KIP.
