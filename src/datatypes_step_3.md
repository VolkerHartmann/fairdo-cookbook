## 3. Register data type(s) in data type registry

In the following steps, Data Types which were not found in the DTR, e.g., marked as <span style="color:orange">Extend</span> or <span style="color:red">Create</span> in your checklist, have to be registered at the DTR. This is done in a reverse order starting with missing Data Types at the lowest hierarchy level. In our case, we start with registering the `permission` Data Type in order to be able to proceed with defining the `aclEntry` Data Type and so forth.
